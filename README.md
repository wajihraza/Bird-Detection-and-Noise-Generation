# Bird-Detection-and-Noise-Generation

This is an end-semester project for the Digital Signal Processing course. In this project, we pre-processed the audio dataset from the publicly available Xeno Canto dataset into mel-spectograms to apply digital signal processing techniques for data preparation. We then trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect the bird species in any area, and achieved a training accuracy of 88% and testing accuracy of 83%.
